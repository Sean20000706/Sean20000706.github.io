Loving can hurt 

Loving can hurt sometimes

But it’s the only thing that I know

When it gets hard

You know it can get hard sometimes

It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph

We made these memories for ourselves

Where our eyes are never closing

Our hearts were never broken

And time‘s forever frozen still

So you can keep me

Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans

Holding me close until our eyes meet

You won't ever be alone

Wait for me to come home

Loving can heal

Loving can mend your soul

And it’s the only thing that I know

I swear it will get easier Remember that with every piece of ya (you)

And it’s the only thing we take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph

We made these memories for ourselves

Where our eyes are never closing

Our hearts were never broken

And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me inside the pocket of your ripped jeans

Holding me close until our eyes meet

You won't ever be alone

And if you hurt me

that’s okay baby only words bleed

Inside these pages you just hold me

And I won't ever let you go

Wait for me to come home

Wait for me to come home

Wait for me to come home

Wait for me to come home

And you can  fit me inside the necklace you got When you were sixteen

Next to your heartbeat where I should be

Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me

But that’s okay baby only words bleed

Inside these pages you just hold me

And I won't ever let you go

When I’m away

I will remember how you kissed me under the lamppost back on 6th street

Hearing you whisper through the phone

Wait for me to come home
